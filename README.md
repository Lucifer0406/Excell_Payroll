# 💰 Employee Payroll – Excel Project

Welcome to my **Employee Payroll** project created using Microsoft Excel! This file simulates a real-world payroll system and reflects my growing proficiency in Excel for business and finance tasks. The project captures detailed salary calculations, overtime tracking, and payment summaries across multiple employees and weeks.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This payroll system calculates:
- Weekly wages for each employee
- Overtime pay
- Bonus earnings
- Total monthly and January-specific pay

Each employee's data includes:
- Name
- Hourly wage
- Weekly work hours and overtime hours
- Automatic calculations for gross pay and bonuses
- Aggregated monthly totals

---

## ✅ Concepts Used

### 1. **Advanced Formulas & Arithmetic Operations**
- Used formulas to compute:
  - **Basic pay** = Hourly Wage × Hours Worked
  - **Overtime pay** = Overtime Hours × Hourly Wage × 1.5
  - **Total Pay** = Basic Pay + Overtime + Bonus
- Ensured all calculations were dynamic and responsive to data changes.

### 2. **Conditional Logic**
- Applied logic to trigger overtime and bonus calculations where applicable.
- Used consistent formula handling to avoid manual entry errors.

### 3. **Data Aggregation**
- Implemented weekly and monthly **summing** of pay for individuals.
- Used `=SUM()` and `=AVERAGE()` to calculate:
  - Total payroll cost
  - Maximum, minimum, and average wages, hours worked, and bonuses

### 4. **Data Visualization (Optional Enhancements Possible)**
- Though this file focuses on detailed tabular calculations, it can easily be extended with:
  - Monthly payroll bar charts
  - Overtime distribution pie charts
  - Employee comparison dashboards

### 5. **Financial Formatting**
- Currency formatting applied for wages and payouts
- Used consistent $ formatting across all payment-related columns
